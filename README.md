My first GitHub repository!

Hello World!

NC here, this is my working through the GitHub guide, since I am a complete neophyte when it comes to anything related to coding.
I have taken the plunge, since I am typing this on my new UHK, which has a GitHub repository where requests can be made i.r.o. the keyboard Agent software.
Since I would love the option of being able to add "comments" in the Agent software, explaining what a specific key combination does, I am effectively learning GitHub â€“ having created an account, to be able to do this! 

Joy!
